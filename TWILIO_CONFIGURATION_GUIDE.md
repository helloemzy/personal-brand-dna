2. Choose a number with SMS capabilities
3. Select a local number or toll-free number

```

### 6. Test Your Configuration

Use this curl command to test (replace with your domain):

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-app.vercel.app/api/phone-auth/send-otp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "phoneNumber": "5551234567",
    "countryCode": "+1"
  }'
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "message": "OTP sent successfully",
  "expiresAt": "2024-07-01T12:45:00.000Z"
}
```

## ðŸ“± SMS Best Practices

### Message Format
The current message template is:
```
Your Personal Brand DNA verification code is: 123456. It expires in 10 minutes.
```

### Rate Limits
- Trial accounts: 1 message per unique phone number per 4 seconds
- Upgraded accounts: Higher limits based on your plan

### Geographic Restrictions
- Trial accounts can only send to verified phone numbers
- To remove this restriction, upgrade your account

## ðŸ”’ Security Considerations

1. **Never commit Twilio credentials to Git**
   - Use environment variables only
   - Add to `.env.local` for local development

2. **Implement rate limiting**
   - The API already logs attempts
   - Consider adding IP-based rate limiting

3. **Monitor for abuse**
   - Check Twilio logs regularly
   - Set up alerts for unusual activity

## ðŸ’° Cost Estimation

### SMS Pricing (US)
- Outbound SMS: ~$0.0079 per message
- Inbound SMS: ~$0.0075 per message
- Phone number: $1-2/month

### Monthly Estimates
- 100 users/day Ã— 30 days = 3,000 OTP messages
- Cost: ~$24/month + phone number
- Total: ~$25-30/month

## ðŸš¨ Common Issues

### "Invalid phone number"
- Ensure number includes country code
- Format: `+1234567890` (with + prefix)

### "Message not received"
- Check if number is verified (trial accounts)
- Verify Twilio balance
- Check spam folder on phone

### "Authentication error"
- Double-check Account SID and Auth Token
- Ensure environment variables are set correctly

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring

### Twilio Console Features
1. **Message Logs**: View all sent messages
2. **Error Logs**: Debug failed messages
3. **Usage Triggers**: Set up alerts for usage limits
4. **Insights**: Analytics on delivery rates

2. Create alerts for:
   - Low balance warning
   - High error rate
   - Unusual usage patterns
