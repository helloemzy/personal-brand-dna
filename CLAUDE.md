## Important Notes

### Voice Analysis Accuracy
- This is the make-or-break feature for product success
- Prioritize accuracy over speed in initial development
- Plan 2-week buffer in timeline for model tuning
- Continuous user feedback collection is critical

### Content Generation Guidelines
- Authentic voice > perfect grammar
- Business outcomes > engagement metrics  
- User safety > automation convenience
- Personal experiences should feel natural, not forced

### LinkedIn Safety
- **NEVER automate posting** - manual posting only
- No LinkedIn automation tools or scrapers
- Focus on content creation, not distribution
- User education about LinkedIn best practices

### Performance Priorities
1. Voice discovery completion rate (90% target)
2. Voice accuracy satisfaction (85% target)  
3. Content acceptance rate (80% target)
4. Business impact attribution (15% users report opportunities)

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
- **OpenAI API changes**: Build abstraction layer for provider switching
- **Voice analysis accuracy**: Continuous testing with diverse user base
- **Performance scaling**: Load testing from Week 8 of development

### Business Risks  
- **Competition from LinkedIn/Microsoft**: Focus on authentic voice differentiation
- **User acquisition costs**: Diversified marketing, product-led growth
- **Economic downturn**: Demonstrate clear ROI, flexible pricing

### Mitigation Strategies
- 2-week buffers in critical path timeline
- Fallback options for all external dependencies
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- Regular user feedback and iteration cycles

This project represents a significant opportunity to solve the authentic voice problem in professional content creation. Success depends on nailing the voice discovery accuracy and maintaining focus on business outcomes over vanity metrics.
