# Workshop Bug Fix Test Plan

## Testing the Brand House Workshop Fix

### Prerequisites
1. Clear browser cache and localStorage
2. Open browser developer tools to monitor console errors
3. Have Redux DevTools extension installed

### Test Steps

1. **Clear Corrupted State** (if any exists)
   ```javascript
   // Run in browser console:
   localStorage.removeItem('persist:root');
   localStorage.removeItem('persist:workshop');
   location.reload();
   ```

2. **Navigate to Brand House Workshop**
   - Login to the application
   - Go to Brand House Assessment
   - Should load without errors

3. **Test Value Selection**
   - Select first trait - should work
   - Select second trait - should work
   - Select third trait - should work
   - **Select fourth trait** - should work (previously crashed here)
   - Continue selecting up to 10 traits (the limit)
   - Try to select 11th trait - should be prevented

4. **Test Redux DevTools**
   - Open Redux DevTools
   - Check that state is displayed without crashes
   - Verify no `_persist` metadata in workshop state
   - Actions should dispatch normally

5. **Test Error Recovery**
   - If any error occurs, error boundary should display
   - "Reset Workshop" button should clear state and restart
   - "Back to Dashboard" should navigate away

### Expected Results
- ✅ No "Something went wrong" error when selecting 4+ traits
- ✅ Redux DevTools doesn't crash
- ✅ State persists correctly between page refreshes
- ✅ Workshop progress saves automatically
- ✅ Error boundary provides recovery options if needed

### Verification in Code
The fixes implemented:
1. Removed double Redux persistence (workshop was persisted at both slice and root level)
2. Enhanced Redux DevTools configuration to handle non-serializable data
3. Added comprehensive null safety checks in workshop actions
4. Fixed component selectors to handle persisted state properly
5. Enhanced error boundary for better state recovery

### Rollback Plan
If issues persist:
1. Clear all localStorage
2. Disable Redux DevTools temporarily
3. Check browser console for specific error messages
4. Report exact error message and stack trace
