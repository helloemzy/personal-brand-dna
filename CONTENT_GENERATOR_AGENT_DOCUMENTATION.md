## Content Generation Examples

### Example 1: Innovative Leader Archetype

**Input**: News about AI transformation in professional services

**Generated Content**:
```
Here's what I'm seeing in the AI revolution:

The latest research shows AI adoption in professional services will triple this year. But here's the breakthrough - it's not about replacing humans, it's about amplifying our unique value.

I've been working with teams navigating this shift, and the pattern is clear: those who embrace AI as a creative partner are seeing 10x productivity gains while delivering MORE human value, not less.

The game-changer? AI handles the repetitive work, freeing us to focus on strategy, relationships, and innovation - the things that actually transform businesses.

We're not just adapting to change. We're leading it.

What's your take - is your industry ready for this acceleration?
```

**Scores**:
- Voice Match: 0.89
- Quality: 0.86
- Risk: 0.12

### Example 2: Empathetic Expert Archetype

**Input**: Same news, different archetype

**Generated Content**:
```
I understand the anxiety around AI in professional services. 

Many of us are wondering: "Will I still have value?" Let me share what I'm seeing with clients navigating this transition.

The firms thriving aren't the ones with the most AI tools - they're the ones who've doubled down on human connection. Yes, AI is handling more tasks, but it's creating space for what truly matters: understanding client needs at a deeper level.

One client told me yesterday: "AI gave me back 10 hours a week to actually listen to my customers."

That's the opportunity here. Not replacement, but renaissance.

How are you using technology to become more human in your work?
```

**Scores**:
- Voice Match: 0.91
- Quality: 0.88
- Risk: 0.08

curl http://localhost:3000/metrics | grep content_generator
```

### Troubleshooting Guide

1. **Low Voice Match Scores**
   - Check if workshop data is complete
   - Verify voice profile generation
   - Review recent content for pattern drift

2. **Slow Generation**
   - Check OpenAI API status
   - Monitor concurrent task count
   - Review prompt complexity

3. **High Risk Scores**
   - Review risk detection keywords
   - Check content angle selection
   - Verify audience appropriateness

## Conclusion
