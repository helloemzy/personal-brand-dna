# Brand House Framework Design

## Overview
The Brand House Framework is a strategic architecture that visualizes a professional's complete brand identity as a structured building. Based on leading brand strategy methodologies from Keller's Brand Equity Model, Aaker's Brand Identity Model, and Simon Sinek's Golden Circle, this framework creates clarity and consistency across all professional communications.
