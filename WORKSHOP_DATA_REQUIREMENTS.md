# Workshop Data Requirements for Brand House Framework

## Executive Summary
To create a complete Brand House Framework, we need to enhance the current 5-step workshop with additional questions and sophisticated data processing. The current workshop collects foundational elements but lacks mission discovery, archetype determination, and content pillar mapping.

## Current Data Collection Analysis

### Step 1: Values Audit ‚úÖ Partially Sufficient
**Currently Collects:**
- 5-10 core values from 35 options
- Value rankings (1-5 importance)
- Custom value creation
- Categories: Leadership, Ethics, Growth, Collaboration, Achievement, Creativity

**Gap Analysis:**
- ‚úÖ Provides foundation for Brand House
- ‚ùå No hierarchy (primary vs supporting values)
- ‚ùå No aspirational values identification
- ‚ùå No value story/context

**Enhancement Needed:**
```
After value selection, add:
1. "Which 2 values are absolutely non-negotiable?" (Primary)
2. "Which values do you aspire to embody more?" (Aspirational)
3. "Share a brief story when you lived one of these values" (Context)
```

### Step 2: Tone Preferences ‚úÖ Sufficient
**Currently Collects:**
- 4 tone dimensions (-50 to +50 scale)
- Preset professional personas
- Communication style preferences

**Gap Analysis:**
- ‚úÖ Good for voice profile generation
- ‚úÖ Maps well to content pillar voices
- ‚ùå No industry-specific tone considerations

### Step 3: Audience Builder ‚úÖ Sufficient
**Currently Collects:**
- Multiple persona definitions
- Pain points and goals
- Communication preferences

**Gap Analysis:**
- ‚úÖ Critical for mission statement "who you help"
- ‚úÖ Informs UVP targeting
- ‚ùå No prioritization of primary audience

### Step 4: Writing Sample ‚ö†Ô∏è Underutilized
**Currently Collects:**
- Text sample (150-1000 words)
- Basic style analysis

**Gap Analysis:**
- ‚úÖ Good for voice matching
- ‚ùå Not analyzed for expertise indicators
- ‚ùå No extraction of experience stories
- ‚ùå No vision/future thinking detection

**Enhancement Needed:**
- Add AI analysis for expertise domains
- Extract story patterns for Experience pillar
- Identify forward-thinking language for Evolution pillar

### Step 5: Personality Quiz ‚úÖ Partially Sufficient
**Currently Collects:**
- 10 personality questions
- Communication trait mapping

**Gap Analysis:**
- ‚úÖ Helps determine archetype
- ‚ùå Questions don't map to specific archetypes
- ‚ùå No professional identity questions

## Missing Data Requirements

### 1. Mission Discovery üö® CRITICAL GAP
**Need to Add:**

#### Path A: Self-Aware Professional
```
Direct Questions:
1. "In one sentence, what change do you want to create in the world?"
2. "Who specifically do you most want to help? (Be specific)"
3. "What's the #1 transformation you help people achieve?"
4. "What's your unique method or approach?"
5. "Complete this: I help [WHO] achieve [WHAT] through [HOW]"
```

#### Path B: Discovery Mode Professional
```
Reflective Questions:
1. "Think about your best day at work - what made it special?"
2. "When do people typically come to you for help?"
3. "What problems do you find yourself naturally solving?"
4. "What compliments do you receive most often?"
5. "If money wasn't a factor, what would you spend your time doing?"
```

**Adaptive Logic:**
```typescript
// Start with self-assessment
"How clear are you on your professional purpose?"
[Very Clear] ‚Üí Path A
[Somewhat Clear] ‚Üí Mix of A & B
[Not Clear] ‚Üí Path B

// Path B leads to insights that generate Path A answers
```

**Data Structure:**
```typescript
interface MissionData {
  clarityLevel: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
  // Path A (direct)
  changeStatement?: string;
  targetAudience?: string;
  transformation?: string;
  uniqueMethod?: string;
  missionDraft?: string;
  // Path B (discovery)
  bestDayStory?: string;
  helpRequests?: string[];
  naturalProblems?: string[];
  commonCompliments?: string[];
  passionWork?: string;
  // AI-generated synthesis
  suggestedMission?: string[];
}
```

### 2. Professional Identity üö® CRITICAL GAP
**Need to Add:**

#### Path A: Established Professional
```
Direct Questions:
1. "What's your current role and years of experience?"
2. "List your top 3 areas of expertise"
3. "What are you known for professionally?"
4. "What's your biggest professional achievement?"
5. "Where do you see your industry/field in 5 years?"
6. "What controversial opinion do you hold about your field?"
```

#### Path B: Emerging/Exploring Professional
```
Discovery Questions:
1. "Describe your work journey - what brought you here?"
2. "What aspects of your work energize you most?"
3. "What do colleagues often ask for your help with?"
4. "What skills come so naturally you forget others struggle?"
5. "What industry problems frustrate you the most?"
6. "What would you change about your field if you could?"
```

**Bridge Questions (For Both Paths):**
```
Story Prompts:
1. "Tell us about a work challenge you're proud of solving"
2. "Describe a time when you felt 'in the zone' at work"
3. "Share feedback that surprised you positively"
```

**Data Structure:**
```typescript
interface ProfessionalIdentity {
  identityClarity: 'established' | 'emerging' | 'exploring';
  // Path A (established)
  currentRole?: string;
  yearsExperience?: number;
  expertiseAreas?: string[];
  knownFor?: string;
  biggestAchievement?: string;
  futureVision?: string;
  controversialOpinion?: string;
  // Path B (discovery)
  workJourney?: string;
  energizingWork?: string[];
  helpRequests?: string[];
  naturalSkills?: string[];
  industryFrustrations?: string[];
  desiredChanges?: string[];
  // Bridge data
  challengeStory?: string;
  flowMoments?: string[];
  surprisingFeedback?: string[];
}
```

### 3. Differentiation Discovery üö® CRITICAL GAP
**Need to Add:**

#### Path A: Clear Differentiator
```
Direct Questions:
1. "What do you do differently than others in your field?"
2. "What's the biggest mistake you see others making?"
3. "What results can you deliver that others can't?"
4. "What's your 'secret sauce' or unique approach?"
5. "Complete: I'm the only [ROLE] who [UNIQUE THING]"
```

#### Path B: Differentiation Explorer
```
Discovery Questions:
1. "What feedback do you get that others in your role don't?"
2. "What feels obvious to you but seems to amaze others?"
3. "What unconventional methods do you use that work?"
4. "What do clients/colleagues thank you for most?"
5. "What would be missing if you left your organization?"
```

**Pattern Recognition Prompts:**
```
Comparison Questions:
1. "How is your approach different from your mentor's/boss's?"
2. "What do you prioritize that your peers overlook?"
3. "What 'rules' in your field do you regularly break?"
```

**Data Structure:**
```typescript
interface DifferentiationData {
  clarityLevel: 'clear' | 'emerging' | 'hidden';
  // Path A (clear)
  uniqueApproach?: string;
  othersMistakes?: string;
  uniqueResults?: string;
  secretSauce?: string;
  uvpDraft?: string;
  // Path B (discovery)
  uniqueFeedback?: string[];

interface AdaptiveWorkshop {
  selfAwarenessScore: number; // 0-100 based on initial questions
  pathSelection: 'direct' | 'discovery' | 'hybrid';
  questionAdaptations: Map<string, QuestionVariant>;
}
```

### Initial Self-Assessment (Before Step 1)
```
Welcome Questions:
1. "How would you describe your career stage?"
   [Just Starting] [Finding Direction] [Established & Growing] [Senior & Evolving]

2. "How clear are you on your professional purpose?"
   [Crystal Clear] [Pretty Clear] [Somewhat Unclear] [Very Unclear]

3. "How easily can you explain what makes you unique?"
   [Very Easily] [Fairly Easily] [With Difficulty] [Can't Really]

Score ‚Üí Path:
- 70-100: Direct Path (knows themselves well)
- 40-69: Hybrid Path (some clarity, needs help in areas)
- 0-39: Discovery Path (needs guided self-discovery)
```

### Discovery Techniques for Low Self-Awareness

#### 1. Story Mining Method
Instead of "What's your mission?", ask:
- "Tell me about a time you felt most fulfilled at work"
- "When have you felt proudest of your impact?"
- "What moments make you think 'this is why I do this'?"

AI analyzes stories to extract:
- Hidden values and motivations
- Natural strengths and talents
- Impact patterns
- Audience served

#### 2. Projection Technique
Instead of "What are your values?", ask:
- "Which leader do you admire and why?"
- "What company cultures attract you?"
- "What LinkedIn posts do you always stop to read?"
- "What TED talks have changed your thinking?"

AI identifies:
- Aspirational values
- Hidden preferences
- Unconscious drivers

#### 3. Contrast Method
Instead of "What makes you unique?", ask:
- "What drives you crazy about how others approach [your work]?"
- "What would you never compromise on?"
- "What shortcuts do others take that you won't?"
- "What do you wish everyone understood about [your field]?"

AI extracts:
- Differentiation points
- Core principles
- Quality standards

#### 4. Future Self Visualization
Instead of "What's your vision?", ask:
- "If you gave a keynote in 5 years, what would it be about?"
- "What would your dream client testimonial say?"
- "What legacy would make you proud?"
- "What problem would you solve if resources were unlimited?"

AI synthesizes:
- Latent ambitions
- True north star
- Impact desires

### AI-Powered Insight Generation

```typescript
interface InsightEngine {
  storyAnalysis: {
    extractThemes(stories: string[]): Theme[];
    identifyValues(stories: string[]): Value[];
    findPatterns(stories: string[]): Pattern[];
  };
  
  synthesis: {
    generateMission(themes: Theme[], values: Value[]): string[];
    suggestArchetype(allData: WorkshopData): BrandArchetype;
    createPillars(patterns: Pattern[]): ContentPillar[];
  };
  
  validation: {
    presentInsights(insights: Insight[]): ValidationPrompt[];
    refineBasedOnFeedback(feedback: Feedback[]): Insight[];
  };
}
```

### Progressive Revelation Process

#### Stage 1: Collection (Steps 1-3)
- Gather stories and preferences
- No pressure to define anything
- Focus on experiences and feelings

#### Stage 2: Pattern Recognition (Step 4)
- AI presents discovered patterns
- "We noticed you often..."
- "Your stories suggest..."
- User validates or adjusts

#### Stage 3: Framework Building (Step 5)
- Co-create mission with AI suggestions
- Choose from generated options
- Refine with guidance

#### Stage 4: Confidence Building (Step 6)
- Test framework with scenarios
- "How would this mission guide you in..."
- Build conviction through application

## Proposed Workshop Enhancement

Add a comprehensive 6th step that captures:
- Mission components
- Professional identity
- Differentiation factors
- Future vision

### Option 2: Integrate Throughout
Enhance existing steps with additional questions:
- Step 1 (Values): Add value hierarchy and stories
- Step 3 (Audience): Add transformation outcomes
- Step 4 (Writing): Add prompts for expertise/vision
- Step 5 (Personality): Add professional identity questions

### Option 3: Two-Phase Workshop
**Phase 1: Discovery (Current Steps 1-5)**
- Values, tone, audience, writing, personality

**Phase 2: Construction (New Steps 6-8)**
- Step 6: Mission & Vision
- Step 7: Expertise & Authority  
- Step 8: Differentiation & UVP

### Option 4: Adaptive Workshop (Recommended for Self-Discovery)
**Smart Path Selection:**
- Pre-assessment determines path
- Discovery questions for unclear professionals
- Direct questions for self-aware professionals
- AI synthesis for pattern recognition
- Validation loops for confidence building

## Data Processing Requirements

### 1. Archetype Determination Algorithm
```typescript
function determineArchetype(data: WorkshopData): BrandArchetype {
  // Weight different inputs
  const valueScore = analyzeValues(data.values);
  const toneScore = analyzeTone(data.tonePreferences);
  const personalityScore = analyzePersonality(data.personalityQuiz);
  const visionScore = analyzeVision(data.professionalIdentity);
  
  // Map to archetypes
  if (valueScore.innovation > 0.7 && visionScore.future > 0.8) {
    return 'Innovative Leader';
  } else if (valueScore.empathy > 0.8 && toneScore.warmth > 0.7) {
    return 'Empathetic Expert';
  } 
  // ... more mappings
}
```

### 2. Mission Statement Generator
```typescript
function generateMission(data: MissionData): string[] {
  // Generate 3 variations
  const templates = [
    `I help ${data.targetAudience} ${data.transformation} through ${data.uniqueMethod}`,
    `My mission is to ${data.changeStatement} by helping ${data.targetAudience} ${data.transformation}`,
    `I ${data.uniqueMethod} to help ${data.targetAudience} ${data.transformation} and ${data.changeStatement}`
  ];
  
  return templates;
}
```

### 3. Content Pillar Mapper
```typescript
function mapContentPillars(data: WorkshopData): ContentPillars {
  return {
    expertise: {
      topics: extractExpertiseTopics(data.professionalIdentity, data.writingSample),
      percentage: 40,
      voice: 'authoritative'
    },
    experience: {
      topics: extractStoryTopics(data.values, data.personalityQuiz),
      percentage: 35,
      voice: 'personal'
    },
    evolution: {
      topics: extractVisionTopics(data.futureVision, data.controversialOpinion),
      percentage: 25,
      voice: 'visionary'
    }
  };
}
```

### 4. UVP Formula Constructor
```typescript
function constructUVP(data: DifferentiationData): string {
  return `I'm the only ${data.currentRole} who ${data.uniqueApproach} 
          that delivers ${data.uniqueResults} for ${data.targetAudience} 
          without ${data.othersMistakes}`;
}
```
