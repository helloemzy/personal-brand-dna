```javascript
// Replace current questions with these 10 power questions
const STRATEGIC_DISCOVERY_QUESTIONS = [
  {
    question: "Tell me about a moment in your career when you felt most aligned with your purpose. What were you doing and why did it matter?",
    analysis_focus: ["values", "purpose", "passion_indicators"]
  },
  {
    question: "If you could wave a magic wand and solve one problem in your industry, what would it be? Walk me through your solution.",
    analysis_focus: ["thought_leadership", "innovation", "problem_solving_style"]
  },
  {
    question: "What's something you believe about your field that most people disagree with? Why do you hold this view?",
    analysis_focus: ["contrarian_thinking", "conviction", "unique_perspective"]
  },
  {
    question: "Describe a time when you had to explain something complex to someone outside your field. How did you approach it?",
    analysis_focus: ["communication_style", "teaching_ability", "clarity"]
  },
  {
    question: "Tell me about your biggest professional win in the last year. What made it special and how did you achieve it?",
    analysis_focus: ["achievement_style", "success_patterns", "confidence"]

```

### 3. Enhanced Content Pillar Generation
Add to the brand framework generation:

```javascript
function generateEnhancedContentPillars(voiceAnalysis, industryContext) {
  const pillars = [];
  
  // Analyze conversation for natural topic clusters
  const topicClusters = extractTopicClusters(voiceAnalysis);
  
  // Industry-specific pillar templates
  const industryPillars = {
    'technology': ['Innovation & Trends', 'Technical Deep Dives', 'Career Growth', 'Industry Analysis'],
    'healthcare': ['Patient Stories', 'Medical Innovations', 'Healthcare Policy', 'Wellness Tips'],
    'finance': ['Market Insights', 'Financial Literacy', 'Industry Trends', 'Leadership'],
    'consulting': ['Client Success', 'Methodology', 'Industry Insights', 'Thought Leadership'],
    // Add more industries
  };
  
  // Generate personalized pillars
  topicClusters.forEach((cluster, index) => {
    const pillar = {
      id: `pillar_${index + 1}`,
      name: cluster.theme,
      description: cluster.description,
      weight: cluster.importance, // percentage
      topics: cluster.specificTopics,
      contentTypes: determineOptimalFormats(cluster, voiceAnalysis),
      postingFrequency: calculateOptimalFrequency(cluster.importance),
      examplePosts: generateExamplePosts(cluster, voiceAnalysis),
      hashtagSuggestions: generateHashtags(cluster, industryContext),
      engagementPotential: predictEngagement(cluster, industryContext)
    };
    pillars.push(pillar);
  });
  
  return pillars;
}
```

### 4. Immediate Frontend Improvements

#### Update `PhoneLoginPage.tsx` for better waiting experience:
```typescript
// Add engaging progress messages during analysis
const analysisStages = [
  { stage: 1, message: "Processing your unique communication style...", icon: "üéØ" },
  { stage: 2, message: "Identifying your brand archetype...", icon: "üèõÔ∏è" },
  { stage: 3, message: "Analyzing your industry expertise...", icon: "üî¨" },
  { stage: 4, message: "Building your content pillars...", icon: "üèóÔ∏è" },
  { stage: 5, message: "Crafting your value proposition...", icon: "üíé" },
  { stage: 6, message: "Finalizing your personal brand framework...", icon: "‚ú®" }
];

// Rotate through stages every 10 seconds
useEffect(() => {
  if (voiceDiscoveryStatus === 'in_progress') {
    const interval = setInterval(() => {
      setCurrentStage((prev) => (prev % 6) + 1);
    }, 10000);
    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }
}, [voiceDiscoveryStatus]);
```

#### Enhance `BrandFrameworkPage.tsx` with immediate value:
```typescript
// Add "See Your Voice in Action" section
const VoiceInAction = () => {
  const [samplePost, setSamplePost] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
  
  const generateSamplePost = async () => {
    setLoading(true);
    const response = await api.post('/api/content/generate-sample', {
      framework: brandFramework,
      topic: 'Recent industry trend',
      style: 'thought_leadership'
    });
    setSamplePost(response.data);
    setLoading(false);
  };
  
  return (
    <div className="bg-blue-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-8">
      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4">üé™ See Your Voice in Action!</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">Here's a sample LinkedIn post in your authentic voice:</p>
      
      {!samplePost ? (
        <button onClick={generateSamplePost} className="btn-primary">
          Generate Sample Post
        </button>
      ) : (
        <div className="bg-white p-4 rounded border-l-4 border-blue-500">
          <p className="whitespace-pre-wrap">{samplePost.content}</p>
          <div className="mt-4 flex gap-2">
            <button className="text-sm text-blue-600">‚ôªÔ∏è Try Another</button>
            <button className="text-sm text-green-600">‚úÖ This sounds like me!</button>
          </div>
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};
```

### 5. Content Schedule Generation
Add to the brand framework API:

```javascript
function generatePersonalizedContentSchedule(framework, tier, userPreferences) {
  const schedule = {
    weeklyCalendar: [],
    contentMix: {},
    optimalTimes: []
  };
  
  // Calculate optimal posting times based on:
  // 1. Industry best practices
  // 2. Target audience activity
  // 3. User's communication energy patterns
  
  const industryOptimalTimes = {
    'technology': ['Tue 9am', 'Wed 2pm', 'Thu 10am'],
    'healthcare': ['Mon 7am', 'Wed 12pm', 'Fri 8am'],
    'finance': ['Tue 8am', 'Wed 4pm', 'Thu 9am'],
    // Add more industries
  };
  
  // Generate 30-day calendar
  const postsPerWeek = {
    'passive': 2,
    'regular': 5,
    'aggressive': 14
  }[tier];
  
  // Distribute posts across pillars
  framework.contentPillars.forEach(pillar => {
    const pillarPosts = Math.round(postsPerWeek * (pillar.weight / 100));
    
    for (let i = 0; i < pillarPosts; i++) {
      schedule.weeklyCalendar.push({
        pillar: pillar.name,
        suggestedTopic: pillar.topics[i % pillar.topics.length],
        format: pillar.contentTypes[0],
        dayOfWeek: optimalDays[i],
        timeSlot: industryOptimalTimes[framework.industry][i]
      });
    }
  });
  
  return schedule;
}
```

### 6. Database Schema Enhancement
Add these columns to track voice evolution:

```sql
-- Add to voice_analysis_results table
ALTER TABLE voice_analysis_results
ADD COLUMN analysis_version VARCHAR(10) DEFAULT '1.0',
ADD COLUMN psycholinguistic_profile JSONB,
ADD COLUMN industry_expertise_score INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
ADD COLUMN voice_consistency_score INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
ADD COLUMN last_evolution_date TIMESTAMP;

-- New table for tracking voice evolution
CREATE TABLE voice_evolution_tracking (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  analysis_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  voice_changes JSONB,
  performance_metrics JSONB,
  adaptation_recommendations JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- New table for content performance learning
CREATE TABLE content_performance_analytics (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  post_id UUID,
  content_pillar VARCHAR(100),
  engagement_rate DECIMAL(5,2),
  voice_match_score INTEGER,
  audience_sentiment VARCHAR(20),
  success_factors JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```
